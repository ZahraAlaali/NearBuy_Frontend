### ***Description***
#### NearBuy is a MERN stack web application that connects users with stores based on city and category.
#### Users can easily browse shops in different cities, explore store details, and view available items. Each shop displays its products with prices and images. Users can add items to their cart and complete purchases directly within the app.

#### On the other side, store owners can register as business users, create their own store, add or update items. This system creates a simple yet efficient bridge between customers and small businesses, helping users shop locally and conveniently.
